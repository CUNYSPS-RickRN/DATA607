In this assignment, use the primary example code in Text Mining in R - Chapter 2 Sentiment Analysis (Silge & Robinson, 2020) and extend the code in the following manner:  
-Work with a different corpus of your choosing  
-Incorporate at least 1 additional sentiment lexicon.


The NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon dataset is used in this code (Mohammad & Turney, 2013).

# A Journal of the Plague Year

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

A Journal of the Plague Year by Daniel Defoe from Gutenberg used as corpus.
NRC Word-Emotion Association Lexicon dataset is used in this code (Mohammad & Turney, 2013).

The corpus will be tokenized and stop words will be removed.

The NRC lexicon used to identify tokens related to "fear" and "joy" found in the corpus in a plague.

A count of words related to fear and joy are ranked by frequency.

Sentiment analysis provides a way to understand the attitudes and opinions expressed in texts.  For example, in A Journal of the Plague Year, a search was made for the sentiments of fear and joy in a plague.  Clearly, "plague" and "infection" are fear related words. However, some words can have dual meanings where "God" elicits both job and fear.
