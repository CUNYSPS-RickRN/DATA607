# Project 1:  Data Analysis - Chess Tournament

In this project, a text file containing results from a Chess Tournament of 64 players will be imported from Github, then manipulated in order to calculate a chess player's mean pre-chess tournament rating of  opponents, and finally create a .csv file for use in subsequent analysis.


Collaborators: Jered Ataky, Dan Rosenfeld, Magnus Skonberg, Rick Sughrue

# 1: Read text file

<style>
div.blue { background-color:#e6f0ff; border-radius: 5px; padding: 20px;}
</style>
<div class = "blue">

In this step, the file is read using read_csv into a dataframe where the first 4 rows containing title were removed along with all rows containing all dashes (--).

Patterns in the data observed:
1.    Each player's information contained in pairs of rows.
2.    "Top line" information in odd numered rows consists of: player's number, name, total points earned in tournament, and for each of the 7 rounds game status (Win, Loss, Draw, Unplayed) and points awarded.
3.    "Bottom line" information in even numbered rows consists of: player's home State/Province, USCF ID, Pre and post ratings, followed by other information.

# 4: Using Patterns to Extract Data Fields

Examined each pair of player rows using Regular Expressions to detect and extract data fields. From the 'top' (odd numbered)' rows: player number, name, total points, and game status for each round.  From the 'bottom' (even numbered)' rows: player's State/Province and Pre-game rating.

A "for loop" iterates through each player row pair and information loaded into OutputCSV_df and Opponents_df dataframes.
